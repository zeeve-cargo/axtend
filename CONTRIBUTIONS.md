## Contributions

Axtend primarily uses GitHub Pull Requests to coordinate code changes. If you wish to propose a
contribution, open a pull request and review the template, which explains how to document your
proposal.

You may also consider joining our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/PfpUATX) or
[Element room](https://app.element.io/#/room/#axtend:matrix.org) to discuss your changes.

### Generated Documentation

You can explore our [crate-level documentation](https://purestake.github.io/axtend).
This documentation is
automatically built and reflects the latest `master` commit.

### Code style

Axtend is following the
[Substrate code style](https://github.com/axiatech/substrate/blob/master/docs/STYLE_GUIDE.md).

In addition, we incorporate several tools to improve code quality. These are integrated into our CI
and are expected to pass before a PR is considered mergeable. They can also be run locally.

* [clippy](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy) - run with `cargo clippy --release --workspace`
* [rustfmt](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt) - run with `cargo fmt -- --check`
* [editorconfig](https://editorconfig.org/) - integrate into your text editor / IDE
* [prettier](https://prettier.io/) - run with `npx prettier --check --ignore-path .gitignore '**/*.(yml|js|ts|json)'` (runs against `typescript` code)
